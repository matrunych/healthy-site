Her team is also using technology to learn more about how to measure and increase the ability to monitor and control our behavior.</p>\n                    <p>“The more you practice self-control, the better you become at it,” says Dr. Leonard Epstein, who studies behavior change and decision-making at the University at Buffalo. “You develop the capacity to act and react another way.”</p>\n                    \n                    <h2>Think About the Future</h2>\n                    <p>Epstein has found that some people have a harder time than others resisting their impulses. He calls this “delay discounting,” where you discount, or undervalue, the larger benefits of waiting in favor of smaller immediate rewards. This can lead to things like overeating, substance abuse, drinking or shopping too much, or risky sexual behavior.</p>\n                    <p>“You can learn to postpone immediate gratification through episodic future thinking, or vividly imagining future positive experiences or rewards,” he explains. “It’s a great way to strengthen your ability to make decisions that are better for you in the long run.”</p>\n                    <p>Epstein is now studying how to use this technique to help people who are at risk for type 2 diabetes prevent the disease.</p>\n                    <p>Focusing on how a change might heal your body and enhance your life can help. When you stop smoking, your risk of a heart attack drops within 24 hours. Reducing stress can lead to better relationships. Even small improvements in your nutrition and physical activity can reduce your health risks and lengthen your life.</p>\n\n                    <h2>Be Patient</h2>\n                    <p>Sometimes when you’re trying to adopt healthier habits, other health issues can get in the way.</p>\n                    <p>“When you’re really struggling with these behaviors, ask yourself if more is going on,” Czajkowski says. “For example, mental health conditions like depression and anxiety can be tied to unhealthy behaviors.”</p>\n                    <p>A health professional can work with you to address any underlying issues to make change feel easier and to help you be more successful.</p>\n                    <p>You’re never too out of shape, too overweight, or too old to make healthy changes. Try different strategies until you find what works best for you.</p>\n                    <p>“Things may not go as planned, and that’s okay,” Czajkowski says. “Change is a process. What’s most important is to keep moving forward.”</p></div>\n                <Foot></Foot>\n            </div>\n        )\n    }\n}"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
