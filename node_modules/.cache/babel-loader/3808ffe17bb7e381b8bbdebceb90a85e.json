calories for how active you are so you balance the energy you consume with the energy you use.</p>\n                    <p>If you eat or drink more than your body needs, you'll put on weight because the energy you do not use is stored as fat. \n                        If you eat and drink too little, you'll lose weight.</p>\n                    <p>You should also eat a wide range of foods to make

Too much saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases your risk of developing heart disease.</p><p>On average, men should have no more than 30g of saturated fat a day. On average, women should have no more than 20g of saturated fat a day.</p><p>Children under the age of 11 should have less saturated fat than adults, but a low-fat diet is not suitable for children under 5.</p><p>Saturated fat is found in many foods, such as:</p><ul><li>fatty cuts of meat</li><li>sausages</li><li>butter</li><li>hard cheese</li><li>cream</li><li>cakes</li><li>biscuits</li><li>lard</li><li>pies</li></ul><p>Try to cut down on your <a href=\"/live-well/eat-well/eat-less-saturated-fat/\">saturated fat intake</a> and choose foods that contain unsaturated&nbsp;fats instead, such as vegetable oils and spreads, oily fish and avocados.</p><p>For a healthier choice, use a small amount of vegetable or olive oil, or reduced-fat spread instead of butter, lard or ghee.</p><p>When you're having meat, choose lean cuts and cut off any visible fat.</p><p>All types of fat are high in energy, so they should only be eaten in small amounts.</p><h3>Sugar</h3><p>Regularly consuming foods and drinks high in <a href=\"/live-well/eat-well/how-does-sugar-in-our-diet-affect-our-health/\">sugar</a>&nbsp;increases your risk of <a href=\"/conditions/obesity/\">obesity</a> and <a href=\"/conditions/tooth-decay/\">tooth decay</a>.</p><p>Sugary foods and drinks are often high in energy (measured in kilojoules or&nbsp;calories), and if consumed too often can contribute to weight gain.
