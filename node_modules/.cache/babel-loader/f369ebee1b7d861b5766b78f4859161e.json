According to the National Cancer Institute, regular\n                                          exercise helps control weight, maintain healthy bones, muscles, and joints, and reduces our risk of high blood pressure, heart \n                                          disease, and diabetes. Further, about 260,000 deaths per year in the U.S. are attributable to the lack of physical activity.</p>\n                                    <p >Many exercise authorities suggest 30 minutes of exercise, 5-6 days a week, giving your body one day to rest and recuperate. The exercise doesn’t have to be\n                                         a gut-wrenching, iron-man type experience. Something as simple as a brisk 30-minute walk can work wonders for your health and \n                                         literally add years to your life. And it can be supplemented by taking the stairs at work, a 10-15 minute walk during lunch, \n                                         or having a small pedaling device at your desk.

At meal time, the Ameri\n                                            can Heart Association recommends a serving of fish twice a week. Besides being a rich source of protein, fatty fish (mackerel, \n                                            salmon, lake trout, herring, sardines, and albacore tuna) have omega-3 fatty acids which reduce the threat of heart disease.</p>\n                                            <p >Don’t forget portion control. If you want to live to be 100, go for larger portions of fruits and vegetables rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, and consume smaller portions \n                                                of higher calorie foods containing large amounts of sugar and fats.</p>\n                                                <p >And chew your food! Many nutritionists recommend chewing each mouthful 20-30 times to get it into its most\n                                                digestible form. Studies have also shown that chewing slowly reduces calorie intake by about 10%, partly because it takes your stomach \n                                                about 20 minutes to tell the brain that it’s full.</p>\n                                                <p>Finally, one other cautionary note regarding a healthy eating habit: be wary of artificial sweeteners. A study conducted over a 10-year period\n                                                 at the University of Manitoba and published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that artificial sweeteners may be \n                                                 associated with an increased risk of obesity, long-term weight gain, diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. Dr. Meghan Azad,\n                                                  chief author of the CMAJ article, commented, “Most people consuming artificial sweeteners do so assuming these products will help \n                                                  them avoid weight gain, diabetes, and heart disease.

Get your sleep</b></p>\n                                            <p>Sleep is crucial to our wellbeing. As we sleep, the brain clears away the debris of the day’s work\n                                                 while resetting and restoring nerve networks so that they can function fully when we wake.</p>\n                                            <p >We all know the most common effects caused by the lack of sleep—drowsiness, fatigue, lack of focus, and forgetfulness. But the consequences of sleep deprivation may go far beyond the well-known, \n                                                and have possibly long-lasting effects on your brain. One recent study from Italy suggests that the consistent lack of\n                                                 sleep may cause the brain to start destroying itself.</p>\n                                            <p >Stated simply, the Italian researchers worked with mice, some getting as much sleep as they wanted while others were subjected to extreme sleep deprivation. The researchers then studied the activity\n                                                 of the glial cells that act as the brain’s caretakers, sweeping out unneeded brain cell connectors (a kind of brain junk) to keep the brain functioning normally. They found that the glial cells were far more active in the sleep deprived mice, \n                                                 and it’s possible that this hyper-sweeping/destructive activity may contribute to Alzheimer’s and other brain disorders.</p>\n                                            <p>To avoid this potential threat, develop the habit of getting a solid 7-9 hours of sleep.
