       <p>The key to a healthy diet is to eat the right amount of calories for how active you are so you balance the energy you consume with the energy you use.</p>\n                    <p>If you eat or drink more than your body needs, you'll put on weight because the energy you do not use is stored as fat. \n                        If you eat and drink too little, you'll lose weight.</p>\n                    <p>You should also eat a wide range of foods to make sure you're getting a balanced diet and your body is receiving all the nutrients it needs.</p>\n                    <p>It's recommended that men have around 2,500 calories a day (10,500 kilojoules). Women should have around 2,000 calories a day (8,400 kilojoules).</p>\n                    <p>Most adults in the UK are eating more calories than they need and should eat fewer calories.</p>\n                \n                </section>\n\n\n                <section >\n                    <h2>1.

They include potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and cereals.</p>\n                    <p>Choose higher fibre or wholegrain varieties, such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or potatoes with their skins on.</p>\n                    <p>They contain more fibre than white or refined starchy carbohydrates and can help you feel full for longer.</p>\n                    <p>Try to include at least 1 starchy food with each main meal. Some people think starchy foods are fattening, but gram for gram \n                        the carbohydrate they contain provides fewer than half the calories of fat.</p>\n                    <p>Keep an eye on the fats you add when you're cooking or serving these types of foods because that's\n                         what increases the calorie content – for example, oil on chips, butter on bread and creamy sauces on pasta.</p>\n                </section>\n\n            \n                <section>\n                    <h2>2.

A portion of dried fruit (which should be kept to mealtimes) is 30g.</p>\n                    <p>A 150ml glass of fruit juice, vegetable juice or smoothie also counts as 1 portion, but limit the amount you have to no more than 1 glass a day as these drinks are sugary and can damage your teeth.</p>\n                </section>\n\n                \n                <section >\n                    <h2>3.
