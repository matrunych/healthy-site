href=\"/live-well/healthy-weight/understanding-calories/\">calories</a> for how active you are so you balance the energy you consume with the energy you use.</p><p>If you eat or drink more than your body needs, you'll put on weight because the energy you do not use is stored as fat. If you eat and drink too little, you'll lose weight.</p><p>You should also eat a wide range of foods to&nbsp;make sure you're getting a balanced diet and your body is receiving&nbsp;all the nutrients it needs.</p><p>It's recommended that men have&nbsp;around 2,500 calories a day (10,500 kilojoules). Women should have around 2,000 calories a day&nbsp;(8,400 kilojoules).</p><p>Most adults in the UK are eating more calories than they need and should eat fewer calories.</p>\n  \n</section>\n\n  \n    \n\n<section id=\"1-base-your-meals-on-starchy-carbohydrates\">\n  \n    <h2>1. Base&nbsp;your meals on higher fibre starchy carbohydrates</h2><p><a href=\"/live-well/eat-well/starchy-foods-and-carbohydrates/\">Starchy carbohydrates</a> should make up just over a third of the food you eat. They&nbsp;include potatoes, bread, rice, pasta and cereals.</p><p>Choose higher fibre or wholegrain varieties, such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or potatoes with their skins on.</p><p>They contain more fibre than white or refined starchy carbohydrates and can help you feel full for longer.</p><p>Try to include at least 1 starchy food with each main meal.

Cut down on saturated fat and sugar</h2><h3>Saturated fat</h3><p>You need some fat in your diet, but it's important to pay attention to the amount and type of fat you're eating.</p><p>There are 2 main types of fat: saturated and unsaturated. Too much saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases your risk of developing heart disease.</p><p>On average, men should have no more than 30g of saturated fat a day. On average, women should have no more than 20g of saturated fat a day.</p><p>Children under the age of 11 should have less saturated fat than adults, but a low-fat diet is not suitable for children under 5.</p><p>Saturated fat is found in many foods, such as:</p><ul><li>fatty cuts of meat</li><li>sausages</li><li>butter</li><li>hard cheese</li><li>cream</li><li>cakes</li><li>biscuits</li><li>lard</li><li>pies</li></ul><p>Try to cut down on your <a href=\"/live-well/eat-well/eat-less-saturated-fat/\">saturated fat intake</a> and choose foods that contain unsaturated&nbsp;fats instead, such as vegetable oils and spreads, oily fish and avocados.</p><p>For a healthier choice, use a small amount of vegetable or olive oil, or reduced-fat spread instead of butter, lard or ghee.</p><p>When you're having meat, choose lean cuts and cut off any visible fat.</p><p>All types of fat are high in energy, so they should only be eaten in small amounts.</p><h3>Sugar</h3><p>Regularly consuming foods and drinks high in <a href=\"/live-well/eat-well/how-does-sugar-in-our-diet-affect-our-health/\">sugar</a>&nbsp;increases your risk of <a href=\"/conditions/obesity/\">obesity</a> and <a href=\"/conditions/tooth-decay/\">tooth decay</a>.</p><p>Sugary foods and drinks are often high in energy (measured in kilojoules or&nbsp;calories), and if consumed too often can contribute to weight gain. They can also cause tooth decay, especially if eaten between meals.</p><p>Free sugars are any sugars added to foods or drinks, or found naturally in honey, syrups and unsweetened fruit juices and smoothies.</p><p>This is the type of sugar you should be cutting down on, rather than the sugar found in fruit and milk.</p><p>Many packaged foods and drinks contain surprisingly high amounts of free sugars.</p><p>Free sugars are found in many foods, such as:</p><ul><li>sugary fizzy drinks</li><li>sugary breakfast cereals</li><li>cakes</li><li>biscuits</li><li>pastries and puddings</li><li>sweets and chocolate</li><li>alcoholic drinks</li></ul><p><a href=\"/live-well/eat-well/how-to-read-food-labels/\">Food labels</a> can help.
